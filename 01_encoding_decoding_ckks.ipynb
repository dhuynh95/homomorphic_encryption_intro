    "CKKS exploits the rich structure of integer polynomial rings for its plaintext and ciphertext spaces. Nonetheless, data comes more often in the form of vectors than polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore it becomes necessary to encode our input $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N/2}$, into a polynomial $m(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N + 1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will denote by $N$ the degree of our polynomial degree modulus, which will be a power of 2. We denote by $\\Phi_M(X) = X^N + 1$ the $m$-th [cyclotomic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotomic_polynomial) (note that $M=2N$). The plaintext space will be the polynomial ring $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N + 1)$. Let us denote by $\\xi_M$, the $M$-th root of unity : $\\xi_M = e^{2 i \\pi / M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how we can encode a vector into a polynomial, and how the computation performed on the polynomial will be reflected in the underlying vector, we will first see a vanilla example, where we simply encode a vector $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N}$ into a polynomial $m(X) \\in \\mathbb{C}[X]/(X^N + 1)$. Then we will cover the actual encoding of CKKS, which takes a vector $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N/2}$, and encodes it in a polynomial $m(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N + 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vanilla encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will cover the simple case of encoding $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N}$, into a polynomial $m(X) \\in \\mathbb{C}[X]/(X^N + 1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will use the [canonical embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding) $\\sigma : \\mathbb{C}[X]/(X^N +1) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^N$, which will serve to decode and encode our vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, to decode a polynomial $m(X)$ into a vector $z$, we will simply evaluate the polynomial on certain values, which will be the roots of the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_M(X) = X^N + 1$. Those $N$ roots are : $\\xi, \\xi^3, ..., \\xi^{2 N - 1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to decode a polynomial $m(X)$, we will simply define $\\sigma(m) = (m(\\xi), m(\\xi^3), ..., m(\\xi^{2 N - 1})) \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$. Note that $\\sigma$ defines an isomorphism, which means it is a bijective homomorphism, therefore any vector will be uniquely encoded into its corresponding polynomial, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part is the encoding of a vector $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ into the corresponding polynomial, which means computing the inverse $\\sigma^{-1}$. The problem is therefore to find a polynomial $m(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\alpha_i X^i \\in \\mathbb{C}[X]/(X^N + 1)$, given a vector $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$, such that $\\sigma(m) = (m(\\xi), m(\\xi^3), ..., m(\\xi^{2 N - 1})) = (z_1,...,z_N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, if we write this down, this means that we have the following system : \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\alpha_j (\\xi^{2 i - 1})^j = z_i, i=1,...,N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be viewed as a linear equation : \n",
    "\n",
    "$A \\alpha = z$, with $A$ the [Vandermonde matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix) of the $(\\xi^{2 i -1})_{i=1,...,N}$, $\\alpha$ the vector of the polynomial coefficients, and $z$ the vector we want to encode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we have that : $\\alpha = A^{-1} z$, and that $\\sigma^{-1}(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\alpha_i X^i \\in \\mathbb{C}[X]/(X^N + 1)$."

    "Now that we saw how we can encode complex vectors into polynomials, let's see how it is done in CKKS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference with what we did previously, is that the plaintext space of the encoded polynomial is $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N + 1)$, therefore the coefficients of the polynomial of encoded values must have integer coefficients, and we saw before that it is not neccessarily the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this issue, one must first look at the image of the canonical embedding $\\sigma$ on $\\mathcal{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because polynomials in $\\mathcal{R}$ have integer coefficients, therefore real coefficients, and we evaluate them on complex roots, where half are the conjugates of the other (see the previous figure), we have that :\n",
    "$\\sigma(\\mathcal{R}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N} : z_j = \\overline{z_{-j}} \\}$. \n",

    "We can see on this picture that $\\omega^1 = \\overline{\\omega^7}$, and $\\omega^3 = \\overline{\\omega^5}$. In general, this means that because we evaluate a real polynomial on them, we will also have that for any polynomial $m(X) \\in \\mathcal{R}, m(\\xi^j) = \\overline{m(\\xi^{-j} )} = m(\\overline{\\xi^{-j}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, any element of $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$ is actually in a space of dimension $N/2$, not $N$. Therefore when we want to encode a vector in CKKS we use complex vectors of size $N/2$, then we need to expand them by copying the other half of conjugate roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation, which takes an element of $\\mathbb{H}$ and projects it to $\\mathbb{C}^{N/2}$ is called $\\pi$ in the CKKS paper. Note that this defines a isomorphism as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we can start with $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N/2}$, expand it using $\\pi^{-1}$ (note that $\\pi$ projects, $\\pi^{-1}$ expands), so we get $\\pi^{-1}(z) \\in \\mathbb{H}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we have is that we cannot directly use $\\sigma : \\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N +1) \\rightarrow \\sigma(\\mathcal{R}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{H}$, because an element of $\\mathbb{H}$ is not necessarily in $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$. $\\sigma$ does define an isomorphism, but only from $\\mathcal{R}$ to $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$. To convince yourself that $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$ is not equal to $\\mathbb{H}$, you can notice that $\\mathcal{R}$ is countable, therefore $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$ as well, but $\\mathbb{H}$ is not, as it is isomorph to $\\mathbb{C}^{N/2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This detail is important, because it means that we must find a way to project $\\pi^{-1}(z)$ on $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$. To do so, we will use a technique called \"coordinate-wise random rounding\", defined in [A Toolkit for Ring-LWE Cryptography](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cpeikert/pubs/toolkit.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, $\\mathcal{R}$ has an orthogonal $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis $\\{1,X,...,X^{N-1} \\}$, and given that $\\sigma$ is an isomorphism, $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$ has an orthogonal $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis $\\beta = (b_1,b_2,...,b_N) = (\\sigma(1),\\sigma(X),...,\\sigma(X^{N-1}) )$. Therefore for any $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, we will simply project it on $\\beta$ :\n",
    "\n",
    "$z = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} z_i b_i$, with $z_i = \\frac{<z, b_i>}{||bi||^2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ because the basis is orthogonal and not orthonormal. Note that we are using the hermitian product here : $<x,y> = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \\overline{y_i}$. Here the hermitian product gives real outputs because we apply it on elements of $\\mathbb{H}$, you can compute to convince yourself, or notice that you can find an isometric isomorphism between $\\mathbb{H}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^N$, therefore inner product in $\\mathbb{H}$ will yield real output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally once we have the $z_i$, we simply need to round them randomly, to the higher or the lower integer, using the \"coordinate-wise random rounding\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have projected on $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$, we can simply apply $\\sigma^{-1}$ which will output an element of $\\mathcal{R}$ which was what we wanted ! \n",
    "\n",
    "One final detail : because the rounding might destroy some significant numbers, we actually need to multply by $\\Delta > 0$ which gives us some precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the final encoding procedure is : \n",
    "- take an element of $z \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N/2}$\n",
    "- expand it to $\\pi^{-1}(z) \\in \\mathbb{H}$\n",
    "- multiply it by $\\Delta$ for precision\n",
    "- project it on $\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$ : $\\lfloor \\Delta . \\pi^{-1}(z) \\rceil_{\\sigma(\\mathcal{R})} \\in \\sigma(\\mathcal{R})$\n",
    "- encode it using $\\sigma$ : $m(X) = \\sigma^{-1} (\\lfloor \\Delta . \\pi^{-1}(z) \\rceil_{\\sigma(\\mathbb{R})}) \\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoding procedure is much simpler, from a polynomial $m(X)$ we simply get $z = \\pi \\circ \\sigma(\\Delta^{-1} . m)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pfiou that was long, but that was all the math, now it will be pretty straightforward to implement in the code so let's do it ! "
